Hello and welcome to the test!

Please read these instructions carefully before going forward.

This test is designed as part of a pilot study into the generation algorithm for signals
used in alarm systems. By taking part, you will contribute to the study, and provide valuable
data which is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm being developed.

How the test works:

You will be presented with sounds over either 10, 30 or 50 trials, twice.

The trial will consist of listening to some NOISE and adjusting a slider until you hear a TONE.

Your aim is to adjust the volume of the TONE
until it is JUST audible over the NOISE.

You will perform the test in 2 rounds, and there will be a short pause between each round.

On the next page, there will be a small training example, and a chance for you to calibrate your
audio levels and listening.

You participation is appreciated.
